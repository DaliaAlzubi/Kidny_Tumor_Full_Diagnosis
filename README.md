Drill-Down Deep Learning Models Using 3D Images:  Kidney Tumor Classification and Segmentation


Our data is new and this is the second work on it, in the first work we detected the tumor(Normal case/Tumor case) and classified its type(Benign/ Malignant), as the second work we classify the subtypes(Benign Subtype+ Malignant Stubtype), plus we segment the tumor(Tumor Location) and identify its stage(I,II,III, and IV). In the First work, we tried to use multiple deep learning models and we discover that the CNN is the best model that gives s the best results, that's why we applied the CNN in this work for the multi-diagnosis.
